# esus
Automatic Debian repository maintaining script. Formerly known as repdeb-helferling.


## About this project
During my time as an employee at the IT department of Brecht Schule Hamburg I started several small projects. One of this project was a self-hosted Debian repository, beacuse I was missing some packages in the official repositories. Therefore I was in need for a script that sources selected Github repositories and downloads the Debian packages from the latest release. Additionally I wanted to automate the creation of the required index files and the signing of Release files. 

Firstly this project was published under ```repo-helper``` and ```repdeb-helferling```. Then after a major update and merge with some other scripts, it was named ```esus```. This name comes originally from a gallic deity of trade and travel.
